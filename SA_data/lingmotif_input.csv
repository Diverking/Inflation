880	2011-01-20	The dreaded stagflation Inflation and recession thrown together create all sorts of policy conundrums for the authorities as was demonstrated in the 1970s."
881	2011-01-20	Interest rates can be raised to put the brakes on inflation , but that runs the risk of slowing down any hopes of economic recovery."
882	2011-01-20	However, it is also being blamed for helping to put a rocket under prices – a problem given that inflation is already on the rise – and also putting a dampener on spending – a nightmare for any chancellor aiming to stimulate growth."
883	2011-01-20	Soaring fuel prices were among the key reasons behind inflation''s sharp rise in December, when the consumer price index (CPI) went up by 3.7%, against 3.3% in November."
884	2011-01-20	The Item Club, a respected group of independent economic forecasters, said in a recent report that if oil averaged $100 over the year it would drive up inflation by a further 0.5% ""threatening UK economic recovery""."
885	2011-01-20	Wages increased by 2.1% on average during the three months to November, well below the 3.7% inflation rate."
886	2011-01-20	When the Conservatives last assumed the reins of economic policy from a Labour government, they inherited an inflation rate of about 10%."
887	2011-01-20	They therefore had no difficulty in presiding over an increase in the inflation rate to more than 20% by the middle of 1980."
888	2011-01-20	Thenceforth, thanks to their discovery of sado-monetarism, the devastation of large swathes of British industry, and a sharp rise in unemployment, they managed by 1983 to bring the inflation rate down to 3.7%."

891	2011-01-20	Membership of the European exchange rate mechanism had become the central plank of counter-inflation policy after the collapse of Chancellor Lawson''s various attempts to control inflation in the 1980s."
892	2011-01-20	My old friend had succeeded Sir Geoffrey Howe at the Treasury in 1983, and inflation had once again risen above 10% by the late 1980s."
893	2011-01-20	The present rate of inflation should be seen in historical perspective and with some sense of proportion."
894	2011-01-20	When inflation rose from 10% to 20% between 1979 and 1980, words such as ""soaring"" and ""surging"" would have been appropriate."
895	2011-01-20	For many years there was a debate among British economists as to whether the UK''s unhealthy proclivity towards inflation was attributable to ""cost push"" or ""demand pull""."
896	2011-01-20	Interestingly, the member who has been most forthright about possible dangers on the inflation front, Andrew Sentance, is shortly to step down from the committee, so those ""teenage scribblers"" will doubtless have a field day examining the previous pronouncements of his successor."
897	2011-01-20	Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: ""The John Lewis figures suggest that consumers are becoming increasingly less prepared – or less able – to spend as higher inflation , fuelled by January''s VAT hike from 17.5% to 20%, and muted earnings growth squeezes their purchasing power."

902	2011-01-20	In November the Office for National Statistics put the average family''s weekly spend at £455, so with today''s rises in CPI and RPI rates of inflation , that average bill will have risen by £22 last month."
903	2011-01-20	So how can households cope with inflation ?"
904	2011-01-20	With CPI at 3.7%, basic rate taxpayers have just one savings account they can use, according to Andrew Hagger of financial comparison website Moneynet.co.uk . A Coventry Building Society bond fixed for five years at 4.75% just exceeds the 4.625% they need to earn to neutralise the combination of basic rate tax and inflation ."
905	2011-01-20	One consequence of rising inflation could be that interest rates go up, raising the monthly outgoings of most households."
906	2011-01-20	Age UK Enterprises'' Silver RPI index , which was developed to show the rate of inflation experienced by older people, indicates that people aged 55 and over have suffered a real RPI rate of between 1.8% and 4.1% on top of the ONS headline rate."
907	2011-01-20	Gordon Morris, managing director of Age UK Enterprises, said: ""The impact of inflation on over-55s has been substantially underestimated and it worsens as you age, with over-75s experiencing cost rises on average 4% above official measures."
908	2011-01-20	Economists are on guard for spikes in inflation around the world that might force up interest rates, which in the developed world are at historically low levels as a result of the banking crisis."
909	2011-01-20	Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics , said: ""The upward pressure on inflation this year from the recent surge in the cost of agricultural commodities will be much greater than that from the pick-up in oil prices""."

916	2011-01-20	Rail fares have gone up by well in excess of inflation ; VAT has gone from 17.5% to 20%; a fresh surge in oil prices to just under $100 a barrel threatens fresh misery for motorists already having to adjust to the idea that it now costs £50 or more to fill up the family car."
917	2011-01-20	On the measure favoured by the government – CPI – inflation is currently 3.3% and is likely to hit 4% within the next few months."
918	2011-01-20	In the 1970s, when Margaret Thatcher was famously pictured holding bags of shopping to show how consumer spending power had been eroded under the Labour government, inflation hit a post-war record of 26%."
919	2011-01-20	In the early 1980s, the Iron Lady herself had to grapple with inflation again above 20% while a third spike in prices to just under 10% as a result of the ill-fated Lawson boom was a factor in Thatcher''s defenestration by her party in 1990."

926	2011-01-20	Thus far, Sentance has been unable to convince the other members of the MPC, but the minutes of the December meeting suggested growing concern about inflation ."
927	2011-01-20	There have been signs that consumer expectations of the future path of inflation have risen; were this to be accompanied by evidence that wage bargainers were securing higher pay deals to compensate for rising prices, the Bank would raise rates."
928	2011-01-20	Some analysts believe this would be a big mistake, akin to the Bank''s failure to cut rates in the summer of 2008, when, although record oil prices of almost $150 a barrel pushed inflation up, the real threat to stability was from a tottering global financial system and recession."
929	2011-01-20	For the first 10 years of its life, the MPC kept inflation within one percentage point of its target and neither King nor his predecessor as governor, Eddie George, was obliged to write an explanatory letter to the chancellor."
930	2011-01-20	For consumers, many coming to terms with pay freezes or modest wage increases, rising inflation means low real incomes."
931	2011-01-20	Geoffrey Dicks at Novus Capital Markets admits that the inflation numbers are going to be ""ugly"" over coming months, but puts this down mainly to VAT and other tax increases."
932	2011-01-20	 Inflation measures that exclude the effect of tax rises are running comfortably below 2%, he says."
933	2011-01-20	To have kept inflation to 2% in the face of higher taxes would have required getting ''CPIY'' inflation [a version of CPI which omits the effects of indirect taxation] down to the 0-0.5% range."

1314	2011-08-20	If people do not believe or are convinced that the ECB is supporting governments, then this could be a severe loss in reputation and the consequences would be that inflation expectations would go up."""
1315	2011-08-20	Wolfson, a Tory peer who has built up a reputation for being something of a Cassandra on the economy, said the outlook was subdued, but added: ""There''s nothing in any of the numbers that I look at, whether it be inflation , or employment or unemployment numbers, that would suggest that the situation''s going to get any worse."""

1322	2011-08-20	Some analysts think there is still more mileage in the gold price because the metal is still worth less than it was at its 1980 peak, which, if adjusted for inflation , was $2-40-200 an ounce in today''s money."
1323	2011-08-20	This time some suggested catalysts have been: • Higher-than-expected inflation in July in the US • A significant fall in the Philadelphia Fed business confidence index (to a level not seen since March 2009) • Worse-than-expected US jobless claims this week • A lack of market-friendly policy action from the meeting on Tuesday between the leaders of France and Germany • Continuing fears over the strength of European banks and a possible freezing of interbank lending But why are markets so volatile? • This correction is an attempt to return to a more sustainable level – investors believe the market rebounded too strongly after 2009 given new"
1324	2011-08-20	Secondly, we are likely to see inflation remain high and with the prospects of further quantitative easing in the UK and US this will translate to an increased erosion of the value of money; something that gold investors tend to crow about... 11.32am: There is more news on Finnish-led demands that the Greeks put up assets as security before the €109bn emergency package agreed in July is signed off."
1325	2011-08-20	Ray Black, an independent financial adviser and managing director of Money Minder, says: With interest rates so low, inflation so high and with such volatility being seen in stock markets, you need to have an active investment strategy and the opportunity to buy quality stock at great value doesn''t come along very often and right now looks like a pretty good time to ''stock up'' on cheap shares."
1326	2011-08-20	The London-based firm''s chief investment strategist Graham Neilson told Reuters: ""There are very deep economic flaws in the whole euro mechanism,"" citing high debt levels, weak growth, divergence between member states and the European Central Bank''s focus on inflation expectations."

1331	2011-08-20	You''ve given up unless there''s an overwhelming case to offset inflation risk."""
1332	2011-08-20	A second reason for the Fed''s restraint, it is increasingly clear, is the opposition of a group of Fed officials who are concerned that the central bank is overly discounting the risk of inflation ."
1333	2011-08-20	But Mr. Bernanke, like his predecessors, places greater emphasis on prices, in part because the Fed has concluded that slow, steady inflation – about 2 percent a year – is the best atmosphere for enduring job growth."
1334	2011-08-20	The Fed projected in June that inflation could reach 2.5 percent this year, a crucial reason for its announcement then that it would pause before considering new measures."
1335	2011-08-20	There are now signs that inflation is abating, as a temporary spike in commodity prices earlier this year works through the economy, and as growth weakens."
1336	2011-08-20	But conservative members of the policy-making board see evidence in past recoveries that inflation can accelerate quickly, with little warning."
1337	2011-08-20	In nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation , national income was 6.7 percent higher in 2010 – a gain that did not come close to matching the 8.2 percent rise in the consumer price index .

1338	2011-08-20	Corporate profits more than kept up with inflation ."
1339	2011-08-20	It may seem counterintuitive that the currency of Japan, a country burdened with sluggish growth and a huge public debt, is seen as a refuge from the debt crisis in Europe .

1342	2011-08-20	Then, the need to fight inflation ruled out an easier monetary policy."
1343	2011-08-20	Back in 1980, a recession was started when the government – despairing of its failure to bring down surging inflation rates – invoked controls aimed at limiting the expansion of credit and making it more costly for banks to make loans."

1354	2011-09-20	But shoppers have also been curbing spending, as many face pay freezes or job losses, and inflation continues to run ahead."
1355	2011-09-20	Our own figures for August showed that spending was only 1.5% higher than in August a year ago, but that is less than inflation and we''ve had a VAT rise."

1357	2011-09-20	The upward pressure on the SFr only started to fade when the US in particular started to fight back against inflation ."
1358	2011-09-20	But as Dhaval Joshi at BCA Research argued recently, while QE may boost GDP – by up to 1.5%, according to the Bank''s analysis – it appears to have done so mainly by pushing up asset prices and profits, benefiting the wealthy but eroding the buying power of lower-paid workers, who find themselves facing higher inflation with little hope of bidding up their wages."

In a blogpost titled ""The Bank of England has made a mess of monetary policy"" , Carswell rails against Threadneedle Street''s failure to rein inflation in."
1704	2012-04-20	And you could argue that high commodity costs have made it very hard for the Bank of England to have much effect on the inflation ."
1705	2012-04-20	Many were also bracing for higher inflation ."
1706	2012-04-20	Several downside risks were cited - including the danger of an economic slowdown in Germany''s trading partners; elevated oil prices; and the general debt crisis. 10.01am: Eurozone inflation data has just been released, showing that the consumer prices index was 2.7% in March, up from an initial estimate of 2.6% (so unchanged from February). 9.52am: In the bond market, Spanish sovereign debt is strengthening in value after this morning''s bond auction (see 9.40am for the details)."
1707	2012-04-20	So, technically a successful auction (Spain was aiming to sell between €2bn and €3bn of bonds), but a sign that investors demand much higher returns in return for holding Spanish debt. 9.32am: The latest UK inflation data is out, and it shows that the rising cost of living accelerated last month."
1708	2012-04-20	The Office for National Statistics said the biggest upward pressure on inflation came from higher food and clothing costs."
1709	2012-04-20	The increase in CPI was in line with analyst forcasts, and brings inflation further away from the Bank of England''s 2% target."

1713	2012-04-20	The question is whether the Bank of England will respond by pumping more money into the economy under its quantitative easing (QE) programme, but it is hamstrung by high inflation ."
1714	2012-04-20	The door is back open to more QE, but the elevated inflation outlook is the biggest obstruction."""
1715	2012-04-20	Oil prices trebled, and consumers and businesses in the gas-guzzling west were hit by a wave of inflation , sending many, including the UK, into recession as demand collapsed."
1716	2012-04-20	Early 1980s Margaret Thatcher took power in May 1979 against a background of rampant inflation , widespread strikes and deep recession."
1717	2012-04-20	Exporters were also struggling with an uncompetitive exchange rate after John Major persuaded Thatcher to enter Europe''s Exchange Rate Mechanism, tying the pound to the mighty deutschmark, in a move that Major and his colleagues hoped would help control inflation ."
1718	2012-04-20	The employers'' organisation has offered a 3% pay rise over 14 months, which amounts to a freeze once inflation of 2.7% is taken into account."
1719	2012-04-20	Bank paperwork showed administrators that Kaupthing''s former bosses accepted that shares put up to repair the security shortfall in the bank''s loan to Robert Tchenguiz had a value of £222m, based on a complex calculation using projected cashflows for 150 years and assumptions about likelyinterest rates and inflation over the period."
1720	2012-04-20	The news about inflation is not good, either for hard-pressed individuals whose incomes are stagnating and therefore falling in real terms, or for the economy generally."
1721	2012-04-20	But back to that inflation figure."
1722	2012-04-20	The Bank of England had been telling us that the rate of inflation was on its way back to 2%."
1723	2012-04-20	This inflation rate would have been considered quite respectable in the 1960s – a period when the distinguished economics commentator Sir Samuel Brittan spent some time in government and kept an interesting diary that has just been published by the British Academy (Inside the Department of Economic Affairs: Samuel Brittan, the Diary of an ""Irregular"", 1964-6, edited by Roger Middleton)."
1724	2012-04-20	 Inflation was a serious problem in the 1970s – in August 1975, the year-on-year increase in retail prices in the UK was 26.9% – and in the 1980s, notwithstanding Margaret Thatcher''s monetarist mission to eliminate it, the average rate of inflation was 7.8% in 1989 and the year-on-year rate hit a peak of 10.9% in September and October 1990."

1726	2012-04-20	Traditionally, successive postwar British governments used fiscal and monetary policy to encourage the growth of aggregate demand in the economy, provided that inflation was not a serious threat."
1727	2012-04-20	But despite the fact that the Bank of England and other forecasters have egg on their computer screens over the latest statistic, which was not meant to be in the scheme of things, this is hardly a moment to panic over inflation ."
1728	2012-04-20	However, if current policies persist here and in the eurozone, there may be panic for reasons that have nothing to do with inflation ."
1729	2012-04-20	That''s going to dampen hopes of more quantitative easing, as it will stoke concerns about inflation ."
1730	2012-04-20	But he argues that there is not enough demand in the eurozone to create a risk of inflation risks."
1731	2012-04-20	Bad policies might lead to high inflation , which erodes bond values, or a bond market might seize up at a time of financial stress."
1732	2012-04-20	From 2000 to 2007, incomes for the bottom 90 percent of earners rose only about 4 percent, once adjusted for inflation ."
1733	2012-04-20	But when overall inflation in Europe is very low, this strategy requires wages in troubled countries to fall, which rarely happens."
1734	2012-04-20	If the European Central Bank aimed for slightly higher overall inflation – say, 3 percent – for a few years, these countries could become more competitive just by holding wage growth below that of their trading partners."

1739	2012-05-20	And the current threat is not the chimera of higher inflation but a long, arctic winter of the eurozone."
1740	2012-05-20	Second, increasing excise duty faster than the rate of inflation via the escalator has the effect of pushing consumers into supermarkets, thereby decreasing the average price paid for alcohol, a perverse outcome for a government that is supposedly seeking the reverse in the name of curbing binge drinking."
1741	2012-05-20	He said the weak state of the economy and the likelihood of inflation falling quickly later this year would spur the Bank of England to dust down its quantitative easing programme and increase the current £325bn of gilt purchases, driving down the yield further."
1742	2012-05-20	This reflects global economic headwinds as well as domestic economic conditions such as the impact of continuing high rates of inflation in the UK,"" the ONS said."
1743	2012-05-20	David Miles, the one member of the Bank''s monetary policy committee (MPC) to vote for further quantitative easing this month, said: ""No one on the MPC feels comfortable with the prolonged and substantial overshoot of inflation above its target level."
1744	2012-05-20	But that does not mean bringing inflation back to target very rapidly is the best thing to do."
1745	2012-05-20	In a situation where weak demand is likely to be having a negative impact upon productive capacity, the cost of having a tighter monetary policy to bring inflation back to target fast will be some long-lasting damage to incomes."""
1746	2012-05-20	China''s economic growth fell to 8.9% in the final quarter of last year and 8.1% in January-March, after Beijing hiked interest rates and tightened other controls to cool inflation ."

1749	2012-05-20	This decision is based on information received over the past few months that suggests that economic conditions have been somewhat weaker than expected, while inflation has moderated,"" the Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, said in a statement."
1750	2012-05-20	Last week, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures showing the annual inflation rate to March was 1.6%, down sharply from 3.1% a year earlier."
1751	2012-05-20	The reserve bank''s target inflation rate for the year is 2% to 3%."
1752	2012-05-20	The bank cited the inflation data and a subdued housing market as reasons behind its decision."
1753	2012-05-20	The Eurozone is currently being buffeted by major headwinds, notably including increased fiscal tightening in many countries, high and rising unemployment, and elevated oil prices which are keeping up consumer price inflation and squeezing companies'' margins. 9.14am: This graph shows how Europe''s service sector has deteriorated in the last couple of months, (leading to this morning''s poor data, see 9.05am) Photograph: Markit It also shows the service sector PMI (the blue line) is a good leading indicator for GDP (the orange line)."

1756	2012-05-20	Recessions, he said, were supposed to follow booms and periods of high inflation : there seemed no reason in this case to expect the worst recession since the 1930s."
1757	2012-05-20	In the five years before the onset of the crisis, across the industrialised world growth was steady and both unemployment and inflation were low and stable."
1758	2012-05-20	Although inflation has fallen back in recent months, it is still too high."
1759	2012-05-20	He added: ""Consumer spending remains under pressure from a considerable list of headwinds, including high unemployment, widespread job insecurity, low pay growth, high inflation and high debt."
1760	2012-05-20	If Greece was shut out of international money markets, the temptation would be to meet the government deficit through printing money, leading to rapid inflation ."
1761	2012-05-20	But capital spending will rise very slightly, to £9.9m (although this may be a fall in real terms, once inflation is taken into account)."
1762	2012-05-20	King went some way to admitting culpability, and even contrition, in conceding that the fashionable view – that controlling inflation was enough to secure stability – was misguided."
1763	2012-05-20	The minutes of the Bank of England''s most recent monetary policy committee (MPC) hinted that rising inflation and the strength of the PMIs had persuaded most members of its rate-setting committee to step back from more electronic money printing, or quantitative easing (QE)."
1764	2012-05-20	We still think that the recent stickiness of inflation will prompt the MPC to pause its QE programme, but if the recent weaker tone of the activity data continue, as we expect, more asset purchases are likely later in the year."""

1769	2012-05-20	At no stage before 2007, however, did King express any kind of desire to have the much bigger role in policing the City that he has now been handed by George Osborne; on the contrary, he was happy for the Bank to focus on ensuring that the government''s inflation target was hit."
1770	2012-05-20	In the summer of 2008, when Britain was in the early stages of a recession that would wipe more than 7% off national output, the Bank was fretting about the spike in inflation caused by rising oil prices."

1777	2012-05-20	Hopefully, inflation will fall back appreciably further and support consumer spending, but this looks like being a gradual process."
1778	2012-05-20	Even if consumer price inflation does eventually fall back further, unemployment is likely to remain high and wage growth muted so the overall environment will likely still be pretty tough for consumers."

2396	2013-08-20	There was speculation a couple of months ago that one of Carney''s first tasks as governor would be to write to George Osborne explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point above the government''s 2% target."

2403	2013-08-20	The Bank has never forecast inflation of higher than 2.5%, even when it was running at more than 5%, so the chances of it doing so when inflation is coming down seem remote to say the least."

2622	2013-11-20	The ECB''s mandate is for a Eurozone consumer price inflation rate of ""close to but just below 2.0%"", and at just 0.7% in October the inflation rate is no longer at a level that can be seen as consistent with the ECB;s target rate."

2624	2013-11-20	If the ECB had not reacted to Eurozone consumer price inflation dropping to just 0.7% in October by cutting interest rates, it could have led the markets to questioning how meaningful the ECB''s forward guidance was."
2625	2013-11-20	While the drop in Eurozone consumer price inflation to just 0.7 in October was obviously the trigger for the ECB''s interest rate cut, the strength of the euro and only gradual Eurozone economic recovery from extended recession also supported the case for lower interest rates."
2626	2013-11-20	The fact that the ECB chose to act now rather than wait until December when the Governing Council will have the ECB staff''s new Eurozone GDP and consumer price inflation forecasts suggests that the bank felt there was a compelling case for prompt action."

2635	2013-11-20	With Eurozone inflation having fallen to 0.7% in Oct, unemployment at record highs and the strong exchange rate a concern, there is an argument for Mr Draghi to ease the pressure, with the supply of credit to the periphery still anaemic."

2659	2013-12-20	The drastic attempt by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, to jolt the moribund economy into life has already borne fruit: since he took power a year ago, growth has picked up to a cracking annual rate of 3%, and deflation of -0.1% year on year in December 2012 had given way to inflation of 1.1% by October."

3143	2014-06-20	With inflation peristently low (but no apparent threat of deflation), the ECB is attempting to spur banks'' lending habits by in essence charging a fee for keeping excess reserves parked at the ECB."

3174	2014-06-20	The Phillips curve was seized upon by policymakers in the 1960s because it suggested they could pick and choose between a bit more inflation and a little less unemployment (or vice versa)."
3175	2014-06-20	The concept went out of fashion in the stagflationary 1970s, but if there is a relationship between wages and inflation all the evidence since – including that since the financial crisis – is that it takes a big and sustained fall in unemployment to prompt an acceleration in wage growth."

3295	2014-08-20	David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies International, has noted that if the monthly changes in prices are the same as they were on average in the 10 years leading up to the financial crisis, inflation as measured by the CPI will be 1.4% by the end of the year and just 1.1% in February, the month seen as the likeliest date for a rate rise."
3296	2014-08-20	With oil prices falling, inflation could be even lower, perhaps below 1%."
3297	2014-08-20	That would leave Carney with the tricky job of having to write a letter to George Osborne explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point below target at the same time as he was putting up interest rates."

3301	2014-08-20	Monetarists, he said, believe that an expansion of debt is like an expansion of money and can cause inflation ."
3302	2014-08-20	More importantly, the newly minted central bank debt, which amounts to more than $5tn (£3tn), is a weak policy that has failed to increase consumer demand and therefore has little effect on inflation ."
3303	2014-08-20	To go back a step, the expansion of money by central banks, familiar to us as quantitative easing (QE), was sold to politicians as a way to encourage bank lending, increase consumer spending and generate moderate inflation ."

3320	2014-09-20	Now Draghi has signalled that, with the eurozone one or two shocks away from deflation, the inflation outlook may soon justify quantitative easing (QE) like that conducted by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan , and the Bank of England: outright large-scale purchases of eurozone members'' sovereign bonds."

3334	2014-09-20	Is the era of high inflation gone forever?"
3335	2014-09-20	In a world of slow growth, high debt, and tremendous distributional pressures, whether inflation is dead or merely dormant is an important question."
3336	2014-09-20	Yes, massive institutional improvements concerning central banks have created formidable barriers to high inflation ."
3337	2014-09-20	In the first half of the 1990s, annual inflation [PDF] averaged 40% in Africa, 230% in Latin America, and 360% in the transition economies of eastern Europe."
3338	2014-09-20	And, in the early 1980s, advanced-economy inflation averaged nearly 10%."
3339	2014-09-20	Today, high inflation seems so remote that many analysts treat it as little more than a theoretical curiosity."
3340	2014-09-20	No matter how much central banks may wish to present the level of inflation as a mere technocratic decision, it is ultimately a social choice."
3341	2014-09-20	And some of the very pressures that helped to contain inflation for the past two decades have been retreating."
3342	2014-09-20	In the years preceding the financial crisis, increasing globalisation and technological advances made it much easier for central banks to deliver both solid growth and low inflation ."
3343	2014-09-20	True, back then, monetary authorities were working with old-fashioned Keynesian macroeconomic models, which encouraged the delusion that monetary policy could indefinitely boost the economy with low inflation and low interest rates."
3344	2014-09-20	But a country''s long-term inflation rate is still the outcome of political choices not technocratic decisions."
3345	2014-09-20	A quick tour of emerging markets reveals that inflation is far from dead."
3346	2014-09-20	According to the International Monetary Fund''s April 2014 World Economic Outlook [PDF], inflation in 2013 reached 6.2% in Brazil, 6.4% in Indonesia, 6.6% in Vietnam, 6.8% in Russia, 7.5% in Turkey, 8.5% in Nigeria, 9.5% in India, 10.6% in Argentina, and a whopping 40.7% in Venezuela."
3347	2014-09-20	These levels may be a big improvement from the early 1990s, but they certainly are not evidence of inflation''s demise."
3348	2014-09-20	Many of the same pundits who never imagined that advanced economies could have massive financial crises are now sure that advanced economies can never have inflation crises."
3349	2014-09-20	Would these countries today have an inflation profile more like the US and Germany or more like Brazil and Turkey?"
3350	2014-09-20	The gain in inflation credibility was offset by weak debt credibility."
3351	2014-09-20	If the European periphery countries had their own currencies, it is likely that debt problems would morph right back into elevated inflation ."
3352	2014-09-20	I am not arguing that inflation will return anytime soon in safe-haven economies such as the US or Japan."
3353	2014-09-20	Though US labour markets are tightening, and the new Fed chair has emphatically emphasised the importance of maximum employment, there is still little risk of high inflation in the near future."
3354	2014-09-20	Recognising that inflation is only dormant renders foolish the oft-stated claim that any country with a flexible exchange rate has nothing to fear from high debt, as long as debt is issued in its own currency."
3355	2014-09-20	Nevertheless, given the huge governance problems that Italy still faces, there is every chance that its inflation rate would look more like Brazil''s or Turkey''s, with any debt problems spilling over faster price growth."

3357	2014-09-20	 Inflation may be dormant, but it is certainly not dead. • Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist of the IMF, is Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University."
3358	2014-09-20	Taken on its own this could suggest that the UK may need to raise rates earlier and more aggressively than previously expected, but in the absence of inflation and wage pressures and with signs that the housing market is cooling we doubt that the Bank of England will move imminently."

3362	2014-09-20	Most analysts expect the consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation to fall to 1.5% from 1.6% in July, as a result of pressure from the ongoing supermarket price war and lower petrol prices, although some are forecasting a drop to 1.4%."

3368	2014-09-20	It said: ""We continue to think that a combination of stable energy bills, lower import prices and weak growth in unit wages will enable CPI inflation to fall to as low as 1% by the end of this year and remain weak in 2015."""

3792	2015-01-20	If the risks that I''m focusing on to our last forecasts come through, I think there is a chance that inflation will pick up faster than people had been expecting in the medium term, which then would most likely merit an increase in interest rates sooner than people are currently expecting,"" Forbes told the Wall Street Journal .

3799	2015-01-20	On the other hand, some of these risks ... imply a substantially lower rate of inflation in the short term, so that even when inflation does start to pick up, it would begin from a very low level and take some time before reaching the 2% target."

3801	2015-01-20	The Bank will publish its latest forecasts for growth and inflation in mid-February."
3802	2015-01-20	During that time, the evidence clearly shows that US inequality exploded, and has continued as the minimum wage has failed to keep up with inflation .

3982	2015-02-20	As British economist Roger Bootle pointed out in his 1996 book The Death of Inflation , the price-cutting effects of globalisation have been a much more important influence on the price level than the anti-inflation policies of central banks."

4300	2015-03-20	Analysts expect the UK''s consumer price inflation (CPI) figure for February, which is released on Tuesday, to fall from 0.3% in January, driven by lower energy and food prices."
4301	2015-03-20	The inflation fall is likely to postpone further an increase in interest rates, which had been expected this year, with some in the Bank of England raising the possibility of a cut from the current historic low of 0.5%."
4302	2015-03-20	Andrew Haldane, the Bank''s chief economist, suggested last week that interest rates could be cut to zero in the coming months to head off the threat of deflation, saying that the monetary policy committee should worry that inflation had ""dropped like a stone""."
4303	2015-03-20	Haldane said the committee believed inflation would remain close to zero in the near term before rebounding in the next two years."
4304	2015-03-20	He added: ""The risks to inflation at that horizon are plainly two-sided."
4305	2015-03-20	The impact of that extra stimulus ... would happen well after the oil price fall had moved through the economy and we would just add unnecessary volatility to inflation ."
4306	2015-03-20	The Office for Budget Responsibility slashed its annual inflation forecast for 2015 down to 0.2% last week."
4307	2015-03-20	 Inflation as measured on the alternative retail price index, which includes housing costs, turned negative for a period in 2009, but this would be the first spell of deflation under CPI for 50 years."

4310	2015-03-20	The combination of low inflation , moderating house price growth and a delay in the base rate rise seems to be working in consumers'' favour,"" he said."

4320	2015-03-20	The latest data showed inflation at a record low of 0.3% on the consumer price index measure."
4321	2015-03-20	The Nationwide report showed the annual rate of price inflation fell for the sixth month running to stand at 5.7% – less than half the 11.8% rate in June 2014 and its lowest level for 16 months."
4322	2015-03-20	The Fed said rates would not rise before ""further improvement in the labor market"" and only when it was confident inflation was moving back to its 2% objective over the medium term."
4323	2015-03-20	The committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run,"" the Fed said in its statement."
4324	2015-03-20	The firm also cited the recent overhaul of the stamp duty regime and improving housing affordability, in the wake of lower unemployment and rising real wages (adjusted for inflation )."
4325	2015-03-20	Likewise, when the Office for National Statistics starts noticing a product, it has well and truly entered the mainstream – and we will see this at work when the ONS tinkers with the shopping basket of goods it uses to measure inflation ."
4326	2015-03-20	 Inflation has already fallen sharply as a result of falling oil prices, with Brent crude dropping on Tuesday by 2% to about $57 a barrel."
4327	2015-03-20	But Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England , ruled out the possibility that Threadneedle Street would respond to much lower than expected inflation with further cuts in interest rates or an expansion of the Bank''s £375bn QE programme."
4328	2015-03-20	Carney told a House of Lords committee on Tuesday that it would be ""extremely foolish"" to use more monetary stimulus to fight a temporary plunge in inflation caused by declining oil prices."
4329	2015-03-20	UK inflation as measured by the consumer price index has already fallen to 0.3% – its lowest level on record – but the governor said further falls to zero were likely in the coming months, with little subsequent change for the rest of the year."
4330	2015-03-20	Ian McCafferty, one of the externally appointed members of the Bank''s monetary policy committee – the nine-strong body that sets interest rates – said the Bank should ""look through"" a temporary fall in inflation caused by cheaper oil."
4331	2015-03-20	Illustration: David Simonds/Observer Sunday 22 March 2015 08.59 GMT Plunging global oil prices, and the resultant drop in inflation , have so far been experienced by British consumers as an unambiguous plus."
4332	2015-03-20	Official figures to be released on Tuesday will reveal whether inflation fell even further in February from January''s 0.3%."
4333	2015-03-20	But a thoughtful – and troubling – speech last week from the Bank of England''s chief economist, Andy Haldane, suggested we should think twice about welcoming a fresh drop in inflation too enthusiastically."
4334	2015-03-20	Today''s labour market doesn''t follow the old-fashioned recipe in which falling unemployment feeds through to inflation Such an increase would be partly thanks to low inflation, but it also depends on the OBR''s expectation that wages will rise at a healthy clip throughout this year – something the Bank''s monetary policy committee is also relying on to bring inflation back towards its target of 2%."

4337	2015-03-20	Month after month, quarter after quarter, since the immediate financial crisis came to an end, the MPC''s forecasts have shown productivity recovering, wages picking up, and inflation bouncing back."
4338	2015-03-20	In other words, today''s labour market just doesn''t follow the old-fashioned recipe in which falling unemployment rapidly feeds through, via wages, to inflation ."
4339	2015-03-20	Stir in weak global demand – one of the factors explaining low inflation , Haldane suggests – and a strengthening pound, which tends to bear down on prices in the short term, and we could be looking at a more prolonged period of low inflation than the MPC has acknowledged."

4341	2015-03-20	His view is glaringly different from that of his boss, Mark Carney, who recently suggested it would be ""foolish"" to react to a drop in inflation that he insisted resulted from a one-off shock to global oil prices."
4342	2015-03-20	To give an idea of how weak wages growth is at the moment, since 1998 quarterly wages growth in trend terms has only been below 0.7% six times; three of those six times have occurred in the past three quarters; and five of them have occurred in the past seven: What is also important when looking at wages is how fast they are growing compared with inflation ."
4343	2015-03-20	If they are rising faster than inflation then ""real wages"" are growing – because it means you are able to buy more things with your wages than you could a year ago."
4344	2015-03-20	Right now real wages are barely growing above inflation and they have grown by less than the 0.7% along term average since March 2013."
4345	2015-03-20	This is important because while Hockey was bizarrely gloating about strong wages growth, in Senate estimates last week, senators Abetz and Bernardi were equally bizarrely trying to suggest that proposed wage rises to public servants – which are well below inflation – are actually generous."
4346	2015-03-20	During the estimates hearings, Abetz and Bernardi worked with the new public service commissioner, John Lloyd, to come up with some truly idiotic short-term logic to calculate inflation and low pay offers for commonwealth public servants, such as the 3.16% over three years rise offered to those working in the Department of Defence, the 0.8% annual pay rise offered to those working for the Australian Taxation Office, or the mere 1.4% rise over three years offered to those working for Abetz''s own Department of Employment."
4347	2015-03-20	Lloyd, who was appointed to the post in December and who previously worked as a director for the rightwing Institute of Public Affairs, is not someone you would say unions see eye-to-eye with, but it was still disappointing to see him go along with the idiocy on low wages served up to him by senators Bernardi and Abetz last Monday . Bernardi and Abetz suggested that because the Reserve Bank was estimating inflation to June this year would grow by just 1.25%, the government''s policy that no public servant would receive a pay rise over the next three years of above 1.5% would in some cases see wage rises that ""at least matches inflation"" or even ""exceed inflation""."

4350	2015-03-20	Bernardi even argued that a pay rise of ""around 2% or 2.5% would be substantially in excess of inflation ""."
4351	2015-03-20	It would,"" he argued, ""be twice the inflation rate."""
4352	2015-03-20	To this Lloyd replied, ""Yes, a 2% increase, of course, is well ahead of inflation , yes."""
4353	2015-03-20	The problem for Bernardi, Lloyd and Abetz is that they only bothered to look forward to the rate of inflation three months to June – ignoring that three years is rather longer than three months."
4354	2015-03-20	Yes, the RBA did indeed predict in its latest Statement on Monetary Policy that inflation in June 2015 would be 1.25%, but a three years wage agreement goes out to the end of 2017 at least."
4355	2015-03-20	Conveniently for us, if not for Bernardi, Lloyd and Abetz, the RBA also estimated inflation out to December 2017 . It estimated inflation for both 2016 and 2017 to be between 2.25% and 3.25% – for a mid-point of 2.75%, which means Bernardi''s assertion that wage rises of ""around 2% or 2.5% would be substantially in excess of inflation"" or ""twice the inflation rate"" is complete crap."

4359	2015-03-20	The only reason inflation is so low right now is because in the past six months petrol prices have fallen around 10%, and because the current inflation rate includes the fall in power prices due to the removal of the carbon price in the September 2014 quarter."

4361	2015-03-20	Most economists expect inflation over the next few years to be below 3%."
4362	2015-03-20	But suggesting a rise in wages of 1.25% over the next three years will be in line with inflation is to live in a fantasy world."
4363	2015-03-20	For a start, the RBA would not let inflation remain so low for so long as it is well below its target band of 2%-3%."
4364	2015-03-20	In the first instance he could have a word with his cabinet colleague and point out that no matter how much you spin it, wage rises below the inflation rate do not provide workers with ""greater prosperity""."

4369	2015-03-20	In the first period of recovery after the crash, rampant oil and food prices drove up average inflation and the Bank ""looked through"" the blip, citing underlying weakness in the prices of other basic goods and services."
4370	2015-03-20	Now it is ""looking through"" ultra-low inflation , driven by a fall in food and oil prices."
4371	2015-03-20	Miles was asked by MPs why he bothers to target inflation when it bounces round uncontrollably like a child in a ball pit."
4372	2015-03-20	Official figures have shown that until late last year, with inflation above target and average wage rises consistently below 2%, real wages suffered."
4373	2015-03-20	The recent fall in inflation means real wages are rising."
4374	2015-03-20	Average pay growth hit 2.1% in the last quarter of 2014 if bonuses are taken into account, 1.7% if they are excluded, which in both cases is far above the 0.5% inflation rate."
4375	2015-03-20	The only reason for the feelgood factor returning is low inflation . Look at the recent GDP figures found business investment falling to levels seen in 2009 while exports remain stagnant."

4386	2015-03-20	It will come as no surprise to the Bank of England that inflation now stands at zero, and the Bank''s governor, Mark Carney, has said it would be ""foolish"" to cut the cost of borrowing in response to what is thought to be a temporary fall in commodity prices."
4387	2015-03-20	They look like remaining there for the rest of this year, and one MPC member – Andy Haldane, the Bank''s chief economist – says he can contemplate voting to cut borrowing costs . That''s because there''s a potential dark side to the fall in inflation , the risk that it becomes a permanent feature of the economic landscape."
4388	2015-03-20	The reason the majority of economists view February''s zero inflation as benign is because they think lower unemployment will put upward pressure on wage settlements."

4578	2015-05-20	UK inflation turns negative Statisticians said this was the first time the CPI had fallen since official records began in 1996 and the first time since 1960 based on comparable historical estimates."
4579	2015-05-20	The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said inflation in April was pushed down by air fares and ferry tickets , probably because of the earlier Easter holidays this year."
4580	2015-05-20	 Inflation has been slowing throughout most of the last two years on the back of falling food and energy prices."
4581	2015-05-20	Is this deflation or negative inflation ?"
4582	2015-05-20	Economists tend to define a brief dip below zero as ""negative inflation "", to distinguish what is likely to be a temporary spell of falling prices on the back of one-off factors from outright deflation."
4583	2015-05-20	Economists also look at core inflation , which strips out the more volatile prices such as energy and food to judge whether we should fear sustained deflation."
4584	2015-05-20	Core inflation in April was 0.8%, the lowest since March 2001, but still well above zero."
4585	2015-05-20	If core inflation were falling it would be deflation."""
4586	2015-05-20	However, we prefer to classify this as ''negative inflation '', with deflation more strictly defined as a period of falling prices that are both sustained and general (i.e. not restrained to one or two sectors)."

4592	2015-05-20	Where next for inflation ?"
4593	2015-05-20	Economists and the Bank of England forecast that inflation will soon rebound, particularly given oil prices have picked up from their lows earlier this year."
4594	2015-05-20	David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, says: Despite inflation falling into negative territory, there is no real risk of a prolonged period of deflation in the UK."
4595	2015-05-20	The underlying reason for low inflation over the past year has been the dramatic fall in energy prices, however oil prices have rebounded in recent months, which will put upward pressure on prices ...

4604	2015-05-20	The dollar appreciated much faster than anyone expected; and, as data for the first quarter of 2015 suggest, the impact on net exports, inflation , and growth has been larger and more rapid than that implied by policymakers'' statistical models."
4605	2015-05-20	Fed officials have started to speak explicitly about the dollar as a factor that affects net exports, inflation , and growth."
4606	2015-05-20	Moreover, verbal intervention will be followed by policy action, because slower growth and low inflation – partly triggered by a strong dollar – will induce the Fed to exit zero policy rates later and more slowly than expected."
4607	2015-05-20	That will reverse some of the dollar''s recent gains and shield growth and inflation from downside risks."

Growth in France was the strongest in two years in the first quarter, fuelled by a surge in consumer spending according to the national statistics office, Insee . Economists had predicted a smaller rebound of 0.4%."
4624	2015-05-20	The Bank''s governor, Mark Carney, is expected to warn investors at the presentation of his quarterly inflation report on Wednesday that the economy remains strong and it would be complacent to rule out an earlier rate rise . The National Institute of Economic and Social Research reported that its monthly growth forecast had risen to 0.4% for the three months to April from 0.3% in the first three months of the year."

4653	2015-05-20	He reiterated the view of the rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) that inflation was likely to remain subdued and this would mean a more gradual pace of rate rises than in the past, as well as rates remaining ""below historical levels for some time to come""."

4712	2015-06-20	With inflation currently low and confidence fragile, the next move in rates is as likely to be a cut as a rise , according to Haldane."
4713	2015-06-20	The current level of interest rates remains, in my view, appropriate to assure the ongoing recovery and to insure against potential downside risks to demand and inflation ."
4714	2015-06-20	With inflation well below the Bank''s 2% target, at just 0.1% , and the economic outlook clouded by the eurozone''s renewed crisis over Greece''s debts , traders are not expecting policymakers to raise interest rates for another 10 months or so."
4715	2015-06-20	Haldane warns that the downward effects from a stronger pound could outweigh the effects of pay growth on inflation ."
4716	2015-06-20	He also needs more evidence of pay growth picking up before worrying about inflation in the wider economy."
4717	2015-06-20	Indeed, this rise is a necessary ingredient for getting inflation back to target in the period ahead."
4718	2015-06-20	He added: ""Consumers'' purchasing power should see marked improvement due to extremely low consumer price inflation and strengthening earnings growth, while employment should see decent growth."

4720	2015-06-20	May''s retail sales figures increased by just 0.2% despite annual wage growth picking up to 2.7% with inflation close to zero after a plunge in oil prices."
4721	2015-06-20	Although inflation and industrial disruption were reduced after 1980, unemployment and inequality have been higher, the analysis found."
4722	2015-06-20	Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider, Markit, said one factor boosting sales was higher disposable income from a combination of improved pay growth and lower inflation – alongside a buoyant labour market, record-low borrowing costs and rising house prices."
4723	2015-06-20	Across the economy, wage growth picked up to an annual rate of 2.7% while inflation remained near zero."
4724	2015-06-20	But at a time of below-trend growth, low inflation outcomes and spare capacity in the labour market, the risks lie with another RBA rate cut,"" he said."
4725	2015-06-20	It would then justify domestic austerity on the grounds that the benefits of the devaluation should not be frittered away in higher inflation ."
4726	2015-06-20	Using the average of 1998 to 2012, with the rise in unemployment in the past year, you would expect wages to be rising by about 3.2%, not 2.3%: The RBA suggests one reason is that firms, unions and even consumers have lowered their inflation expectations."
4727	2015-06-20	As a rule, union executives generally expect inflation to be higher than business leaders, but the RBA notes that both now expect inflation to grow by less than the 20-year average – as they have thought for over three years: And when your inflation expectations are low, there is less pressure to have wages grow fast to stay ahead of the growth of prices."
4728	2015-06-20	As a rule, union executives generally expect inflation to be higher than business leaders, but the RBA notes that both now expect inflation to grow by less than the 20-year average – as they have thought for over three years: And when your inflation expectations are low, there is less pressure to have wages grow fast to stay ahead of the growth of prices."

4730	2015-06-20	Thus, even though inflation expectations have lowered, wages are still rising by less than inflation – there is more to low wages growth than just lowered inflation expectations."
4731	2015-06-20	Thus, even though inflation expectations have lowered, wages are still rising by less than inflation – there is more to low wages growth than just lowered inflation expectations."

4733	2015-06-20	During the mining boom, our real exchange rate – which looks at our exchange rate, labour costs and inflation relative to our trading partners – rose faster than our nominal exchange rate: All other things being equal, a rise in the real exchange rate reduces our international competitiveness."
4734	2015-06-20	Certainly this would explain why during 2012 and 2013 employment growth remained positive while the number of hours worked fell: Thus, a combination of excess capacity in the labour market from rising unemployment, a slowdown of economic growth, declining inflation expectations, a reversal of the good fortunes of rising export prices, a need to rebalance after the mining boom, and a more flexible IR system have all combined to deliver record low wages growth."
4735	2015-06-20	Certainly since mid-2012 new EBAs have contained wage rises below the average rate of all EBAs in existence – and the rate continues to decline: Even worse, the RBA suggests the fact that ""many firms and employees have been reluctant to bargain for wage growth below expected inflation of 2–3%"" is due to the historical belief that inflation is generally above 2%, and employers feel that wages rises below that amount are bad for ""worker morale and productivity"" and can also hurt ""the retention of quality staff."""

4777	2015-07-20	For a number of policymakers, however, it was the threat posed by rising wages on the Bank''s inflation target of 2% and not just the ""very material factor"" of Greece ''s debt standoff that influenced their vote to keep rates on hold."

4806	2015-07-20	The big difference between inflation and cost of living figures is the treatment of housing."
4807	2015-07-20	Thus, during the period where the RBA was slashing rates, the cost of living for employee households (which are the most likely to have a mortgage to pay off) fell faster than other households despite house prices and rents also rising: And because housing price rises were a major contributor to the increase in the CPI, it''s not surprising that for the first time since 2013, all households saw their cost of living rise by less than the official inflation figure: But while low cost of living rises is good, it doesn''t immediately translate into good times because it only looks at one side of the ledger."

4836	2015-08-20	Fed vice-chairman hints at interest rate increase in speech on inflation Carney, speaking at an annual US central banking conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming , reiterated his view that the recovery in Britain''s economy ""will likely put the decision as to when to start the process of gradual monetary policy normalisation into sharper relief around the turn of this year""."
4837	2015-08-20	Although inflation in Britain is almost zero, the bank is likely to start raising rates in the first quarter of next year as wage growth picks up, economists predict."
4838	2015-08-20	Carney said on Saturday a Chinese slowdown could add to pressure pushing down on prices in Britain and risk aversion in global markets could make financial conditions in the country tighter, which would also weigh on inflation ."
4839	2015-08-20	He also said the Bank could ""look through"" the temporary disinflationary impact on inflation from lower demand in China for commodities but would watch for any longer-lasting impact on Britain from a slowing of the world''s No 2 economy."
4840	2015-08-20	But it does indicate that recent events do not yet, to my mind, merit changing the MPC''s [Monetary Policy Committee''s] strategy for returning inflation to target,"" he said."
4841	2015-08-20	Yes, there will be a short delay to the expected date for a first interest rate increase, but all the signals are still pointing towards a normalisation of global growth, wages, inflation and interest rates."
4842	2015-08-20	The City said the 25-00-200 increase in unemployment on the internationally- agreed measure in the three months ending in June together with a lack of evidence of wage inflation would make it harder for the Bbank to justify an early increase in interest rates."
4843	2015-08-20	Figures do not prove EU migrants are taking new UK jobs or driving down pay The state of the labour market is one of the most important indicators looked at by Threadneedle Street''s the bBank''s monetary policy committee, and the current figures point to falling demand for jobs, fewer hours being worked, and little evidence of a surge in pay inflation ."
4844	2015-08-20	Until now, Carney has stated that inflation is rising and that it will force the Bank to increase UK interest rates, possibly next spring."
4845	2015-08-20	All of this will lead to low inflation ."
4846	2015-08-20	He also believes inflation is a worry."
4847	2015-08-20	In many ways, it sowed the seeds of its own destruction, the emphasis on exchange rate competitiveness and foreign exchange reserve accumulation morphing into undue monetary laxity, excessive credit growth, asset price inflation , income inequalities, and malign financial imbalances similar to those built up in the advanced economies pre-2007."""

4851	2015-08-20	The Conservatives pledged in their election manifesto that regulated rail fares in England would rise by no more than inflation if they won."
4852	2015-08-20	UK inflation rise fuels debate over interest rate hike Following the RPI figure announcement, the passenger watchdog Transport Focus said that while fares were increasing, train punctuality was going down for many."
4853	2015-08-20	In an article in the Times (£) on Tuesday, transport ministerClaire Perry said regulated fares would be held at the rate of RPI inflation ."
4854	2015-08-20	In 2010 rail fares fell by 0.4% after the previous July''s rate of RPI inflation was -1.4%, because fare rises were based on RPI plus 1%."
4855	2015-08-20	Falling oil prices and a strong pound are likely to have anchored inflation at zero for a second successive month in July, giving further reason for Bank of England policymakers to delay raising interest rates."
4856	2015-08-20	City economists said official figures to be published on Tuesday are likely to show consumer price inflation (CPI) remained at zero last month."
4857	2015-08-20	Low pay, low inflation and low interest rates?"
4858	2015-08-20	Looking ahead, inflation is likely to turn negative again for a couple of months,"" said Samuel Tombs of consultancy Capital Economics . ""Supermarket competition should drive petrol prices down before long."
4859	2015-08-20	He said: ""Our call on the CPI is that inflation will remain at zero in July, although we judge that there is a material chance that it will ease back into negative territory."""
4860	2015-08-20	Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank, said inflation may have nudged up in July, but only to 0.1%, despite a fall in petrol prices of about 0.7% on the month."
4861	2015-08-20	Therefore, interest rates will need to be increased well before inflation hits our 2% target."
4862	2015-08-20	The Bank''s last monetary policy summary, published at the same time as it announced its last decision to keep interest rates on hold, said the drag on import prices was expected to push down on inflation ""for some time to come""."
4863	2015-08-20	The Bank concluded: ""The near-term outlook for inflation is muted."
4864	2015-08-20	The falls in energy prices of the past few months will continue to bear down on inflation at least until the middle of next year."
4865	2015-08-20	Nonetheless, a range of measures suggest that medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored."""

4867	2015-08-20	In an interview with the Sunday Times , David Miles, who steps down from the MPC this month, said that the case was building for a rate rise, despite inflation being likely to stay low."
4868	2015-08-20	Unsurprisingly, that was taken as a strong hint that there would be further falls in the yuan, which when adjusted for inflation has appreciated by 50% against the dollar in the past 10 years."
4869	2015-08-20	Falling commodity prices will drive inflation even further below target and the falls in the exchange rates of emerging market countries will result in deflation being exported to the west."
4870	2015-08-20	Stephen Williamson,vice-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, has just issued a study in which he concludes : ""There is no work, to my knowledge, that establishes a link from QE to the ultimate goals of the Fed – inflation and real economic activity."

4895	2015-08-20	Michael Hanson, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, saw Fischer''s remarks as an explanation of why the Fed might not wait for inflation to move closer to 2% before raising rates."

4919	2015-08-20	Recent falls in oil and commodity prices, coupled with the cheapening of imports more generally as a results of a stronger pound, will probably mean inflation turns negative again over the coming months."
4920	2015-08-20	The Fed looks closer to what Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Atlanta Fed, calls ""lift off"" . As in the UK, however, inflation is well below target even when volatile items such as food and fuel are excluded from the calculation of the cost of living index."

4928	2015-08-20	UK inflation rise fuels debate over higher interest rates Predictably, this was seen as bringing the date of a rate rise closer, and because higher interest rates tend to act as a magnet for global hot-money flows, the pound rose on the foreign exchanges."
4929	2015-08-20	The inflation figures tell us next to nothing about when interest rates are going to go up, for the following reasons."
4930	2015-08-20	First, the pickup in CPI inflation was almost entirely due to the timing of the summer sales for clothes and shoes."
4931	2015-08-20	Second, annual inflation is likely to fall again next month once the recent drop in oil and commodity prices start to show up in the official numbers."
4932	2015-08-20	 Inflation will pick up this year as last year''s big falls in oil prices cease to have a downward impact on the annual rate, but it will remain well below the government''s 2% target."
4933	2015-08-20	That is the message from the global economy, where all the signs point to low inflation for years to come, robbing central banks of any reason to raise the base rates that set the benchmark for mortgages, overdrafts and loans."
4934	2015-08-20	Some central banks might even be forced to pump more funds into their economies through those inelegantly titled quantitative-easing programmes just to keep inflation from sinking again into negative territory."
4935	2015-08-20	 Inflation for July is expected to be zero when the official figure is published this week – a long way from the 2% target Carney is supposed to have in his sights."
4936	2015-08-20	With the return of ultra-low oil prices in recent months, inflation could even be negative."
4937	2015-08-20	The MPC might say it expects inflation to be higher in a couple of years, justifying a rate rise sooner."
4938	2015-08-20	It will also point to the pressure on wages (and therefore inflation ) from the economic miracle of the last few years that has created almost 2m jobs."
4939	2015-08-20	Yet the ripple effects will be felt, nonetheless, in lower inflation across the west."
4940	2015-08-20	But, with the growth outlook less certain and inflation kept low by cheaper commodities, the Bank and the Fed may well hold off, economists reckon."

4985	2015-09-20	By dramatically increasing interest rates to fight inflation , policymakers broke the power of organised labour, while avoiding blame for the mass unemployment that monetary austerity was bound to produce."
4986	2015-09-20	A few years later, Friedman''s so-called natural rate was replaced with the less value-laden and more erudite-sounding ""non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment"" (Nairu)."
4987	2015-09-20	But the basic idea was the same: if monetary policy is used to try to push unemployment below some pre-determined level, inflation will accelerate without limit and destroy jobs."
4988	2015-09-20	A more extreme version of the theory asserts that there is no lasting tradeoff between inflation and unemployment."
4989	2015-09-20	Monetary policy must therefore focus solely on hitting inflation targets, and central bankers should be exonerated of any blame for unemployment."

5014	2015-09-20	For that reason there is now a fairly solid academic and central bank consensus that by ruling out this kind of political interference, independence helps keep inflation low, and less variable, and also helps smooth the booms and busts in the business cycle."
5015	2015-09-20	One of the elements of the debate I sense is that inflation control is something only the right are supposed to worry about."
5016	2015-09-20	Richard Murphy, Corbyn''s economics guru, has written on the web about his dissatisfaction with the primacy of the BoE''s inflation objective, and McDonnell has suggested adding targets on inequality and unemployment .

5021	2015-09-20	Wolfson said adding in the cost of general wage inflation , including the living wage premium (LWP), the wage bill would rise by £147m to 2020, which could add 6% to prices."
5022	2015-09-20	Wolfson warned that there was a danger of the higher pay level stoking inflation if the rise to £9 an hour by 2020 took it beyond the target of 60% of median pay."

5024	2015-09-20	But he added: ""If, however, wage inflation runs below 3.5% then achieving £9 in 2020 may be problematic, as it would mean raising the LWP above 60% of the median wage."

5125	2015-09-20	In deciding not to raise rates for now, the Fed cited such concerns , saying that inflation could remain lower than expected because of weak economic growth in emerging markets like China."

5148	2015-09-20	About half of the shortfall in inflation over the last year was the result of lower energy prices, and most of the rest was the result of a stronger dollar."
5149	2015-09-20	She said the role of economic slack in holding down inflation was steadily diminishing, which is the reason she expects a rebound as the temporary restraints fall away."
5150	2015-09-20	The fact that these survey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the same levels that prevailed prior to the recession suggests that, once the economy has returned to full employment (and absent any other shocks), core inflation should return to its prerecession average level of about 2 percent,"" she said."

5152	2015-09-20	To be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few years, we need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid economic growth and further gains in resource utilization, with longer-term inflation expectations remaining near their prerecession level,"" she said."

5268	2015-11-20	 Inflation has been completely absent from the UK economy since February as low oil and commodity prices, plus a stronger currency, have helped bring down prices."""
5269	2015-11-20	Economists expect inflation to rise in the coming months, however, as the effect of the sharp declines in oil prices at the end of 2014 drops out of the calculations."

5282	2015-11-20	Much of the inflation within the economy stems from higher rents and home values."
5283	2015-11-20	Fed officials have been carefully monitoring the economy for an upturn in inflation as part of its plan to eventually raise short-term interest rates from historic lows."
5284	2015-11-20	The US central bank targets inflation at 2%, enough to encourage a healthy level of consumer spending while also warding off risks of deflation that could cause the economy to stall."
5285	2015-11-20	The strong job market has traditionally justified higher Fed rates, except that the level of inflation associated with a stable economy has yet to materialize."
5286	2015-11-20	The Fed''s preferred measure of inflation , personal consumption expenditures, has less of an emphasis on housing costs and has risen just 0.2% from a year ago."
5287	2015-11-20	Global economic pressures are also dampening inflation ."
5288	2015-11-20	The minutes of the October meeting showed that Fed officials think the the job market would improve further and that inflation would begin to move toward their 2% target."

5294	2015-11-20	The Bank hinted that UK interest rates were not likely to rise as quickly as economists had expected, but it also trimmed its growth and inflation forecasts."

5299	2015-11-20	But the reason hasn''t been a wages breakout, but rather that inflation has been so low that it is almost impossible for wages to stay below or equal with them."
5300	2015-11-20	Consider over the past three years, in which interest rates have been slashed and overall inflation growth has been near record low, the cost of living still rose on average by 1.23% each year."
5301	2015-11-20	Currently union officials expect inflation to rise by 2.3% annually over the next two years – a level lower than market economists predict: And so our wages continue to grow meekly, and the IR system continues to work as those who value a flexible system would wish it to."

5303	2015-11-20	There will be plenty to chew over as the Bank simultaneously releases its inflation report, interest rate decision and the minutes of that policy meeting followed by a press conference with its governor, Mark Carney . It is only the second such deluge from the Bank, dubbed ""Super Thursday"" in the City and marks a move away from the previous trickle of information favoured by Threadneedle Street."
5304	2015-11-20	But Andy Haldane and newcomer Jan Vlieghe ""appear to be firmly in the ''dovish'' camp"", Wells said, adding: ""The inflation report is therefore very likely to keep all options open and make no commitments on policy,."""

5306	2015-11-20	Financial markets pushed back the chances of a rate rise over coming months following the Bank''s latest forecast for inflation to stay close to zero for now and rise only slowly next year."
5307	2015-11-20	The rest of the committee disagreed and, reflecting a broad range of views in recent speeches, the minutes highlighted divisions among policymakers over the outlook for troubled emerging markets such as China, inflation and growth."
5308	2015-11-20	The Bank used its latest Inflation Report to reassure borrowers and businesses that when interest rates do start to rise, they will do so only slowly, and to a lower level than in the past."
5309	2015-11-20	Since then, global growth has lost momentum, while in the UK, low oil prices and cheap imports have pulled inflation down to below zero – way off the Bank''s target of 2%."
5310	2015-11-20	The Bank''s quarterly outlook said that based on recent falls in oil and other commodity prices, "" inflation is likely to remain lower than previously expected until late 2017"" and return to the target of 2% in about two years'' time, then rise above it."
5311	2015-11-20	The Fed''s overriding objective is to lift inflation and ensure that it remains above 2%."
5312	2015-11-20	To do this, Yellen will have to keep interest rates very low, even after inflation starts rising, just as her predecessor Paul Volcker had to keep interest rates in the 1980s very high, even after inflation started falling."

5314	2015-11-20	In the 1980s, Volcker''s historic responsibility was to reduce inflation and prevent it from ever rising again to dangerously high levels."
5315	2015-11-20	Today, Yellen''s historic responsibility is to increase inflation and prevent it from ever falling again to dangerously low levels."
5316	2015-11-20	And even assuming that interest rates reach 1-1.5% by the end of 2016, they will still be very low by historic standards, both in absolute terms and relative to inflation ."

5328	2015-11-20	Unlike headline inflation , the core measure of the cost of living did not turn negative and reached a trough of 0.8% in April and June this year."
5329	2015-11-20	It will be the core rather than the headline measure of inflation that the Bank of England will be focusing on in the months to come, and the small rise in October has convinced some City analysts that a rate increase in the first half of 2016 is possible."
5330	2015-11-20	Firstly, inflation has been lower for longer than Threadneedle Street imagined at the start of the year."
5331	2015-11-20	Second, wage pressures remain weak, in large part because employers have adjusted down pay offers to reflect the lower level of inflation ."
5332	2015-11-20	It means that, while the UK''s flirtation with deflation is over, the MPC will want stronger evidence of a real underlying increase in inflation before it pulls the interest rate trigger."
5333	2015-11-20	It blamed delays in planning decisions on a number of high profit-margin sites, as well as shortages of skilled tradesmen which have held back building and pushed up wages, although it added that this cost inflation was showing signs of moderating."

5345	2015-12-20	The impact of that will be to keep inflation lower than any of the world''s major central banks are anticipating."
5346	2015-12-20	Policymakers at the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (ECB) insist they ""look through"" rises and falls in oil and other commodity prices and make their interest rate judgments on the basis of what is happening to core inflation , which excludes energy and food costs."
5347	2015-12-20	But it is harder to raise interest rates if, for whatever reason, inflation continues to undershoot official forecasts."
5348	2015-12-20	More importantly, there is evidence that a fall in inflation caused by cheaper oil has an effect on wage bargaining."
5349	2015-12-20	When, in the pre-crisis years, UK inflation regularly hit the government''s 2% target, employers used to offer pay awards of 4%."
5350	2015-12-20	Now that inflation is zero they see no reason to offer more than 2%."
5351	2015-12-20	That matters because central banks are looking for signs of wage inflation picking up as a result of years of steady growth and falling unemployment."
5352	2015-12-20	If wage inflation does not go up, there is less of a reason to raise the cost of borrowing."
5353	2015-12-20	So prediction number one for next year is that both inflation and interest rates will stay lower for longer than currently anticipated."
5354	2015-12-20	The economy is contracting at its fastest rate since the 1930s, inflation is above 10%, the currency has collapsed and the finance minister has just resigned."
5355	2015-12-20	She said the economy ""has come a long way"", though normalization ""is likely to proceed gradually"", and "" inflation continues to run below our longer-run objective""."
5356	2015-12-20	 Inflation appears to be under control – mitigating an imminent need to slow the economy by raising rates."
5357	2015-12-20	But the slowdown still left earnings growth 2.3 percentage points above consumer price inflation of 0.1% in November."
5358	2015-12-20	The objections have some force but, after three decades in which executive pay has lost touch with general pay inflation and returns to shareholders, it is reasonable to try something new."
5359	2015-12-20	The low price of oil has helped to reduce the rate of inflation in many of the leading economies and theoretically frees up demand for other goods."
5360	2015-12-20	UK inflation turns positive again - business live The agreement, effectively a reverse takeover of Aveva, would have left it less vulnerable to the tumbling price of oil."
5361	2015-12-20	What should matter in economic policy and the performance of the economy is balance in the economy as a whole, and as full a use of resources as is consistent with a tolerable rate of inflation , a viable balance of overseas trade and payments, and longer-term considerations about the environment."
5362	2015-12-20	It is hardly a good use of resources and economic potential if the budget is balanced when unemployment is still high and inflation is negligible."
5363	2015-12-20	Even now, although unemployment is much lower than it was, there are many people working part-time who would rather work longer, and inflation is hardly a constraint."
5364	2015-12-20	Indeed, in this country we had decades when incomes policies of various sorts were used in an effort to keep inflation down; now we have ""living wage"" policies and chronically low interest rates in an effort to raise inflation to the official target rate."

5368	2015-12-20	Illustration: ONS and Bank of England calculations However, Threadneedle Street concluded that a 2% rise in average wages this year and low inflation had increased disposable incomes enough for the average mortgage-payer to cope with a rise in base rates to 2%."
5369	2015-12-20	With inflation set to pick up relatively rapidly in the coming months and interest rates expected to rise at some point in 2016, there''s a risk that the pace of the living standards ''rebound'' will slow."
5370	2015-12-20	Shafik said the rate of earnings growth in the UK had ""levelled off"" recently and that other factors were also keeping inflation low, such as the strong pound and a drop in commodity prices."
5371	2015-12-20	It was the 13th straight month of double-digit growth in disposable incomes but the £14 extra spending boost fell short of the £17 average seen during the rest of 2015, thanks to a slight increase in inflation . The figures follow signs that households are starting to feel the effects of a flattening off in pay growth . Incomes improve, but at a slower pace"
5372	2015-12-20	With inflation close to zero, and expected to bounce back only gradually in the new year, that would still deliver a rise in living standards for workers."
